## Quick Start

1. **Database Setup**:
   
   Before running PulseCore, ensure you've set up the necessary PostgreSQL tables. The following table schemas need to exist:

   CREATE TABLE users (
       user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
       password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
       date_created TIMESTAMP DEFAULT current_timestamp
   );

   CREATE TABLE game_stats (
       stat_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id),
       game_played VARCHAR(50),
       properties JSONB,
       date_played TIMESTAMP DEFAULT current_timestamp
   );

   CREATE TABLE rooms (
       room_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       room_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       max_players INT DEFAULT 10,
       current_players INT DEFAULT 0,
       status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'available',
       properties JSONB,
       date_created TIMESTAMP DEFAULT current_timestamp
   );
